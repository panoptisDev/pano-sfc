# Special Fee Contract

The Special Fee Contract (SFC) manages a set of chain validators and their delegations on the Pano chain.
It receives internal epoch-sealing transactions created by the Pano node to handle reward distribution.
The communication between the SFC and the Pano node is mediated by the NodeDriver and NodeDriverAuth contracts.
